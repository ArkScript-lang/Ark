### Deprecated

### Removed

## [3.2.0] - 2022-02-19

- the compiler can finally optimize tail calls
- suggesting symbols to the user when the compiler encounters an unbound symbol

### Changed
- the compiler can now remove unused values from the stack
- enhancing the compiler code
- debloating the parser methods argument's lists

## [3.1.3] - 2022-01-29
### Added
- adding an ExecutionContext to host the pointers (instruction, page, stack) and execution related structures (stack, locals, scopes), to ease the transition to a parallelized VM
    - the VM can have multiple independant context running on the same bytecode
- the VM now takes a reference to an `Ark::State` instead of a raw non-owning pointer
- adding `ARK_PROFILER_MIPS` to toggle instruction per second calculation
- adding new way to typecheck in builtins
- new CI build step now running valgrind to check for memory leaks
- new type checker (to be used by builtins)
- better type errors generation (with the list of arguments, if they are matching or not, and more)

### Changed
- splitting Utils.hpp into multiple files for easier maintenance and contextualisation
- reserving a default scope size of 3, which yields really good performance results compared to nothing being reserved
- upgrading the builtins error handling to use the `BetterTypeError`
- the VM now displays the debug info (ip, pp, sp) at the end of the backtrace instead of the beginning

### Removed
- `BetterTypeError` has been removed in favor of a type checker using templates and an error generator

### Deprecated
- deprecating `VM(State*)` in favor of `VM(State&)`

## [3.1.2] - 2021-11-02
### Added
- adding support for append_in_place, concat_in_place, pop_list and pop_list_in_place in the bytecode reader
- added `page_ptr(int)` in the compiler to replace `&page(int)`
- added literals `_u8` and `_u16`
- added table overflow detection in the compiler, to avoid creating unusable bytecode (checks if the symbols/values table is full or not)
- new Installer.iss (inno setup script) to generate a Windows installer
- new exceptions for type errors

### Changed
- using `doc_formatting.first_column` instead of `doc_formatting.start_column` when displaying the CLI help
- brand new cmake build system
- renaming `Ark/Config.hpp` to `Ark/Platform.hpp`

- changed the ARKSCRIPT_PATH to be a collection of paths to look into, separated by `;`
- updating replxx to avoid a bug when compiling with clang

### Removed
- removed `ARK_SCOPE_DICHOTOMY` flag so that scopes don't use dichotomic search but a linear one, since it proved to be faster on small sets of values. This goes toward prioritizing small functions, and code being cut in multiple smaller scopes
- removing `download-arkscript.sh` from the repo
- removed `isFraction`, `isInteger`, `isFloat` from Ark/Utils.hpp (worked on strings and used regex)
- removed mpark variant to use standard variant

- macros are being handled right after the parsing, before the AST optimizer can run
    - if macros: `!{if compile-time-value then [optional else]}`
    - values macros: `!{name value}`
    - functions macros: `!{name (a b c ...args) body}`

- new module to manipulate bits: `bitwise`
- enhanced standard library

### Changed
- updating doxyfile and some docstrings
- updating the download script
- enhancing examples
- creating a Scope allocates 4 pairs instead of 2, reducing the number of reallocations needed
- `tailOf` renamed to `tail` and `headOf` to `head` ; no need to keep the relics of the past
- `headOf` (now `head`) returns the real head of a container (List or String), the first element (nil if the list is empty, "" if the string is empty)
- the http module was updated to add `http:params:toList` and fix the `http:server:[method]` when passing a function
- fixing the compiler when we encounter get fields in lists
- updating the parser to support usually invalid constructions when they are in macros, to allow things like `!{defun (name args body) (let name (fun args body))}`
- updated the lexer to add UTF8 support and allow unconventional identifiers as long as they aren't keyword nor operators, so things like `->` now works

- fixed lexer, which wasn't adding the last token it read under some specific conditions

### Removed
- `~UserType`, since we are doing manual memory management now
- `Frame` were removed because they were giving bad performances
- `firstOf` was removed because it's basically a `(@ list 0)` and it was doing the job of `head`
- `Ark::Utils::toString`, our internal version of `std::to_string`
- use of static in the MacroProcessor and in the NodeType to string conversion function
- `Ark::Logger` was removed in favor of `std::cout/cerr` + `termcolor`

- renamed `isDir?` to `dir?` for consistency
- the lexer is no longer using regexes but a char after char method
- an ArkScript program is no longer a single bloc, but can be composed of multiple bloc, thus we don't need to use a single big {} or (begin) bloc for all the program

- updating error messages in the VM
- updated the repl to add auto completion, coloration and persistance by @PierrePharel
- moving the parser, lexer and AST node to Compiler/ from Parser/
- better import error messages at parsing

- firstOf, tailOf and headOf now returns [] or "" instead of nil when they have nothing to do
- adding a brand new scoping system, lighter, more powerful
- `str:find` now returns the index where the substring was found

- renaming CLI feature options:
    - `-ffunction-arity-check` becomes `-ffac`, same for the `-fno-` version
    - `-fauthorize-invalid-token-after-paren` becomes `-faitap`, some for the `-fno-` version
- improving compiler performances by using const ref when passing nodes around
- renaming the FFI "builtins" because it's not a FFI but a set of functions using the VM API

- `isNaN` and `isInf` should work on any type but return false if they aren't numbers
- replacing Ark with ArkScript in source code and files (Ark being the shortname for ArkScript, as JS is the shortname for Javascript)

- `import` should be able to load plugins, also `import` takes only one argument now
- **breaking change** `POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE` is now an absolute jump as well
- upgrading CMakeLists to add `-rpath` option to the linker (with GCC), so that it still finds the lib after being installed

### Removed
- `hastype` keyword because I never had to implement compile time typechecking, so it's not useful

## [1.2.2-dev] - 2019-05-02
### Added
- adding `import` keyword (handled by parser), throwing an error if a cyclic included is detected

### Changed
- CMakeLists.txt to add `install` rules: installing ArkScript in bin/ and the ArkScript standard library in share/.Ark/lib/
- updated documentation

## [1.2.1-dev] - 2019
### Added
- runtime typechecking
- exceptions (in the C++ ArkScript API)

### Changed
- updated the FFI to add the runtime typechecking
- micro optimization: using numbers as variable names internally, instead of strings

### Removed
- unnecessary destructors removed to let the compiler auto generate T(T&&) (to avoid implicitly using T(const T&))

## [1.2.0-dev] - 2019
### Added
- syntactic sugar handling in the parser
- GMP lib to handle very large number
- REPL (can be launched from the CLI)
- tests

### Changed
- changed syntax: using `{...}` as a `(begin ...)` and `[...]` as a `(list ...)`
- updated documentation according the new syntax
- the lexer is now using a Token structure to store the line and column as well as the token itself
- generating the FFI using include/Ark/MakeFFI.hpp, everything defined in one file to avoid having 2 files to update
- tests

### Removed
- dozerg::HugeNumber, it was too slow

## [1.1.0-dev] - 2019
### Added
- test.cpp to try to embed ArkScript into a C++ project
- updated the documentation
- the compiler can now return a read only version of the bytecode being executed
- the VM can take a bytecode or a filename
- *OOP* test with ArkScript using closures
- closures support
- Types.hpp (for the VM) to store the definitions of the NFT (Nil/True/False enum class) and the PageAddr_t
- Function.hpp to get a lambda from the interpreter and call it from C++ code

### Changed
- CMakeLists.txt, adding an option to chose between compiling main.cpp or test.cpp
- moved the VM FFI into include/Ark/VM

## [1.0.0-dev] - 2019
## Added
- beginning of the documentation
- compiler (ark code to ark bytecode)
- bytecode reader (human readable format)
- dozerg::HugeNumber to handle big numbers
- simple VM handling all the instructions, able to run an ark bytecode
- interpreter and VM FFI
- logger

## [0.1.0-dev] - 2019
### Added
- Node (to represent an AST node and a Node in the language)
- Environment to map variables and values
- Program executing ArkScript code from the AST
- standard library (builtin functions)
- Lexer and parser
- default CLI can handle the interpreter
- tests
- utils to play with files

## [0.0.1-dev] - 2019
### Added
- utils to play with strings and numbers
- default CLI (using clipp)
- CMakeLists to compile the project
- ryjen::format to format strings
