# demonstration of the creation of a function
# we create a constant named fact, and put a function in it
# taking a single argument, n
(let fact (fun (n) {
    (mut a 1)
    (mut acc 2)
    # then we use a loop (for loops doesn't exist in ArkScript)
    (while (<= acc n) {
        (set a (* a acc))
        # thus we need to increment the accumulator ourselves
        (set acc (+ 1 acc))
    })
    # the return value
    a
}))

# then we call the function we just created
(print "Factorial 6 (with loop and acc): " (fact 6))
