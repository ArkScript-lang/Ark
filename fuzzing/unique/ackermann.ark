# the Ackermann Peter function (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function)
# One of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function,
# that is not primitive. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable,
# but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions
# are primitive recursive.
# Due to its definitions in terms of extremely deep recursion, it can be used as a
# benchmark of a compiler's ability to optimize recursion, which is the reason why
# we are using this function to benchmark the language.

(let ackermann (fun (m n) {
    (if (> m 0)

            # then
            (ackermann (- m 1) 1)
            # else
            (ackermann (- m 1) (ackermann m (- n 1)))
        )
        # else
