# Before starting

You will still need to dive a bit into the documentation of the project, to know how:
* the VM API works, and what it provides
* the possibilities of the Value type (comparisons, creations)
* how to use the `UserType`

Also, read the [RFC 004](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/rfc/blob/master/004-module-error-handling.md) about module error handling to use the same conventions as the other modules, and the [RFC 003](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/rfc/blob/master/003-naming-convention.md) about naming conventions in ArkScript (specifically see the *Modules (C++)* section).
