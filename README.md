* [Documentation](https://arkscript-lang.github.io/documentation.html)
* Discord server: [invite link](https://discord.gg/YT5yDwn), to discuss the specification of the language and receive help
* [Modules](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/modules)

**Nota bene**: the project is referred as "Ark" and as "ArkScript". The official public name is "ArkScript" since "Ark" is already being used by [another language](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark)

## Key features

ArkScript is
* small: the compiler and the virtual machines fit under 8000 lines, but also small in terms of keywords (it has only 10)!
* a scripting language: it's very easy to embed it in your application. The builtin construction is quite easy to understand, so adding your own functions to the virtual machine is effortless
* portable: it produces a bytecode which is run by its virtual machine, like Java but without the `OutOfMemoryException`
* a functional language: every parameter is passed by value, everything is immutable unless you use `mut` to define a mutable variable
* powerful: it can handle object-oriented programming in a very elegant way with its closures and explicit captures (see examples/church-encoding)
* promoting functionalities before performances: expressiveness often brings more productivity, but performances aren't bad at all
* easy to compile: it takes less than 200ms to compile and check a complex code with a lot of branches and sub-branches of 200 lines.
* a Lisp-like, but with fewer parentheses: `[...]` is expanded to `(list ...)` and `{}` to `(begin ...)`. More shorthands will come in the future.
* extensible: it is very easy to create a C++ module to use in the language

Also it has:
* a REPL with autocompletion and coloration
* a growing standard library, composed of ArkScript (under `lib/std/`) and C++ (under `lib/ext/`)
* a lot of unit tests, which are ran before every release to ensure everything work as intended
* docker images:
    * [stable](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkscript/stable)
    * [nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkscript/nightly)

## Examples

### Fibonacci suite

```clojure
(let fibo (fun (n)
    (if (< n 2)
        n
        (+ (fibo (- n 1)) (fibo (- n 2))))))

(print (fibo 28))  # display 317811
```

## More or less game

```clojure
# more or less game
(print "More or less game!")

(import "random.arkm")
(import "Math/Arithmetic.ark")

(let number (mod (abs (random)) 10000))
(print number)
(mut value 0)
(mut tries 0)

(mut continue true)

(while continue {
    (set value (toNumber (input "Input a numeric value: ")))

    (if (< value number)
        # then
        (print "More!")
        # else
        (if (= value number)
            # then
            { (print "Bingo!") (set continue false) }
            # else
            (print "Less!")))

    (set tries (+ 1 tries))})

(print "You won in" tries "tries")
```

More examples are available in the folder `examples/`.

### Contributing to the ArkScript standard library

See [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/Ark/wiki/Coding-guidelines#coding-in-ark) if you want to write ArkScript for the library (see folder `lib/std/`).

For performance reasons, some functions might be written in C++, in `include/Ark/Builtins/Builtins.hpp` and `src/Builtins/`.

### Code structure

![ArkScript code structure](images/arkscript-code-structure.png)

## Building

### Dependencies

* C++17
* CMake >= 3.12
* Visual Studio >= 11 (on Windows)
* On macOS versions prior to 10.15, `libc++` lacks `filesystem` in the standard library.
    * Install a newer compiler using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/): `brew install gcc && brew link gcc`
    * Pass compiler path to `cmake` in the build step: `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-9`

Some libs already included in [thirdparties](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/thirdparties).

### Through CMake

Different CMake switches are available to customize the build:
* `-DARK_BUILD_EXE` to generate an executable, defaults to Off, building a shared library only
* `-DARK_ENABLE_SYSTEM` to enable `sys:exec` (execute shell commands without restrictions), defaults to On
* `-DARK_PROFILER` to enable the [coz](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz) profiler, defaults to Off
* `-DARK_PROFILER_COUNT` to count every creation/copy/move of the internal value type, defaults to Off
* `-DARK_SCOPE_DICHOTOMY` to activate the dichotomic mode of the scope, defaults to Off

## Performances

See https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/benchmarks

## Games

You can find a snake created in ArkScript in the folder examples/games/snake (run it from there, otherwise it won't find the font and the sprites ; you won't need to install the SFML).

![ArkSnake](images/ArkSnake.png)

Controls are the arrows (left, right, up and down), the game closes itself when you successfully collect the 3 apples.
