* [Documentation](https://arkscript-lang.dev/documentation.html)
* Discord server: [invite link](https://discord.gg/YT5yDwn), to discuss the specification of the language and receive help
* [Modules](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/modules)

**Nota bene**: the project is referred as "Ark" and as "ArkScript". The official public name is "ArkScript" since "Ark" is already being used by [another language](https://github.com/ark-lang/ark)

## Key features

ArkScript is
* **small**: the core fit under 8000 lines of code ; also small in terms of keywords (only 10)
* **a scripting language**: very easy to embed it in your projects. Registering your own functions in the language is made easy
* **portable**: a unique bytecode which can be run everywhere the virtual machine is
* **a functional language**: every parameter is passed by value, everything is immutable unless specified
* **powerful**: provides closures and explicit capture
* **promoting functionalities before performances**: expressiveness often brings more productivity, though performances aren't left behind
* **a Lisp inspired language**, with fewer parentheses: `[...]` is expanded to `(list ...)` and `{}` to `(begin ...)`
* **extensible**: supports C++ module to use it in the language, adding functionalities

Also it has:
* **macros**: if/else, values, and functions
* a REPL with autocompletion and coloration
* a growing standard library, composed of ArkScript code (under `lib/std/`) and C++ (under `lib/ext/`)
* a lot of unit tests (but never enough), which are ran before every release to ensure everything works as expected
* docker images:
    * [stable](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkscript/stable), built after each release
    * [nightly](https://hub.docker.com/r/arkscript/nightly), built after each commit

## Examples

### Fibonacci suite

```clojure
(let fibo (fun (n)
    (if (< n 2)
        n
        (+ (fibo (- n 1)) (fibo (- n 2))))))

(print (fibo 28))  # display 317811
```

## More or less game

```clojure
(import "random.arkm")
(import "Math.ark")

(let number (mod (abs (random)) 10000))

(mut value 0)
(mut tries 0)
(mut continue true)

(while continue {
    (set value (toNumber (input "Input a numeric value: ")))

    (if (< value number)
        (print "More!")
        (if (= value number)
            {
                (print "Bingo!")
                (set continue false)
            }
            (print "Less!")))

    (set tries (+ 1 tries))
})

(print "You won in " tries " tries")
```

More examples are available inside `examples/`.

### Coding guidelines for contributing

See [C++ Coding guidelines](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/Ark/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#c-coding-guidelines) if you want to contribute to ArkScript compiler / runtime.

Also, see [ArkScript Coding guidelines](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/rfc/blob/master/001-coding-guidelines.md) for other files, written in ArkScript.

For performance reasons, some functions might be written in C++, in `include/Ark/Builtins/Builtins.hpp` and `src/Builtins/`.

### Code structure

## Building

### Dependencies

* C++17
* CMake >= 3.12
* Visual Studio >= 11 (on Windows)
* On macOS versions prior to 10.15, `libc++` lacks `filesystem` in the standard library.
    * Install a newer compiler using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/): `brew install gcc && brew link gcc`
    * Pass compiler path to `cmake` in the build step: `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/bin/g++-9`

All the external libraries we use are already included in [thirdparties](https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/thirdparties).

### Through CMake

Different CMake switches are available to customize the build:
* `-DARK_BUILD_EXE` to generate an executable, defaults to Off, building a shared library only
* `-DARK_ENABLE_SYSTEM` to enable `sys:exec` (execute shell commands without restrictions), defaults to On
* `-DARK_PROFILER` to enable the [coz](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz) profiler, defaults to Off
* `-DARK_PROFILER_COUNT` to count every creation/copy/move of the internal value type, defaults to Off
* `-DARK_PROFILER_MIPS` to enable the MIPS counting, defaults to Off
* `-DARK_NO_STDLIB` to avoid the installation of the ArkScript standard library
* `-DARK_BUILD_MODULES` to trigger the modules build

```bash
# first, clone it
git clone --depth=50 --branch=dev https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/Ark.git
cd Ark
git submodule update --init --recursive
# building Ark
cmake . -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARK_BUILD_EXE=On
cmake --build build --config Release
# installing Ark (might need administrative privileges)
cmake --install build --config Release
```

Desired output of `arkscript --help`:
```bash

## Performances

See https://github.com/ArkScript-lang/benchmarks

## Games

You can find a snake created in ArkScript in the folder examples/games/snake (run it from there, otherwise it won't find the font and the sprites ; you won't need to install the SFML).

![ArkSnake](images/ArkSnake.png)

Controls are the arrows (left, right, up and down), the game closes itself when you successfully collect the 3 apples.
