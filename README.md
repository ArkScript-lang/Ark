# Ark

Documentation: [doc/main.md](doc/main.md)

## Key features

* Ark is small: the compiler, and the virtual machines fit under 5000 lines, but also small in term of keywords (it has only 10)!
* Ark is a scripting language: it's very easy to embed it in your application. The FFI is quite easy to understand, so adding your own functions to the interpreter or the virtual machine is effortless
* Ark can run everywhere: it produces a bytecode which is run by its virtual machine, like Java but without the `OutOfMemoryException`
* Ark is a functional language: every parameters are by passed by value, everything is immutable unless you use `mut` to define a mutable variable
* Ark can handle object oriented programming using closures in a very elegant way (see example below)
* Ark handles first class objects, thus it has higher-order functions
* Ark is fast: the compiler takes less than 200Âµs to compile and check a complex code with a lot of branches and sub-branches of 200 lines.
* Ark is a Lisp-like, but with less parentheses: `[...]` is expanded to `(list ...)` and `{}` to `(begin ...)`. More shorthands will come in the future.

## Example

```clojure
{
    (let create-human (fun (name age weight)
        # return value as higher order function to manipulate the data above
        # this will be our "constructor"
        (fun (f)
        {
            # all the setters must be defined in this scope
            (let set-age (fun (new-age) (set age new-age)))

            # and then we can call the function
            (f name age weight set-age)
        })
    ))

    # define function to play with the human more easily
    (let print-human-age (fun (_ age _ _) (print age)))
    (let set-human-age (fun (new-age)
        (fun (_ _ _ set-age) (set-age new-age))
    ))

    (let bob (create-human "Bob" 0 144))
    (let john (create-human "John" 12 15))

    (bob print-human-age)   # prints 0
    (bob (set-human-age 10))
    (bob print-human-age)   # prints 10

    (john print-human-age)  # prints 12
}
```

## Contributing

* First, [fork](https://github.com/SuperFola/Ark/fork) the repository
* Then, clone your fork: `git clone git@github.com:username/Ark.git`
* Create a branch for your feature: `git checkout -b feat-my-awesome-idea`
* When you're done, push it to your fork and submit a pull request!

Don't know what to work on? No worries, we have a [list of things to do](https://github.com/SuperFola/Ark/projects) :wink:

## Notes

* The execution of some programs is slower than expected, due to some operators being used like functions, but we are working on it, a brand new FFI is coming soon!
* The language is a bit limited in term of what it can do, because we are working on performance improvement and some brand new features, but adding builtin functions and operators is easy, so we will work on that as soon as possible

## Performances

The project was compiled on Linux Mint 18 x64, with g++ 8 and `-DNDEBUG -O4 -s`.

The test here is the Ackermann-Peter function with m=3 and n=6:
